                                Proximity &mdash;
Panos K. Chrysanthis’s website best adheres to proximity. Starting strong, his welcome page clearly creates a separation between his name and his professional attributes while maintaining a visual connection due to their separate yet proximate proximity. This adhesion to proximity continues to the end as his website similarly creates separate yet proximate groupings of content ranging from headers and related content, to images and related descriptions, to navigational links which lead deeper into content related to their proximite sections.

                                Orientation &mdash;
Panos K. Chrysanthis’s website is the best example of orientation. While on the main page, I knew exactly where I was, and I could clearly see what other locations I could travel to due to the very visible navigation bar toward the left of the screen. That said, further travel into deeper sections of his website caused my orientation to crumble due to a lack of breadcrumbs and a lack of consistency in layout. These issues can be seen when comparing the website’s teaching section and its proximate short courses page.

                                Breadcrumbs &mdash;
The School of Design at Carnegie Mellon’s website best adheres to the usage of breadcrumbs. While navigating, the website provides breadcrumbs on the top navigation bar as to which of the six main sections you are currently located. Furthermore, the sidebar to the right of each main section provides further breadcrumbs which indicate exactly where you are located in that particular section and what other locations are available.

Contrast &mdash;
The School of Design at Carnegie Mellon’s website best adheres to the usage of contrast. While navigating, the website provides breadcrumbs on the top navigation bar as to which of the six main sections you are currently located. To indicate breadcrumbs, they create contrast through the usage of different colors of orange. Furthermore, they use contrasting sizes, weights, and styles for headers in relation to their content. They also contrast links from standard text by changing their color to orange.

                                Consistency &mdash;
The School of Design at Carnegie Mellon’s website best adheres to the usage of consistency. The layout of the webpage stays consistent throughout a users entire navigational experience. While navigating, the websites navigational menus, sidebars, and content all stay in the same areas. Furthermore, the color scheme is kept constant throughout.

                        <p class="overall">
                        Overall Best<br>
The School of Design at Carnegie Mellon’s or TSOD CMU’s website, overall, best adheres to the aforementioned qualities. Though some of the sites provided for critic for this assignment have highlights of adhesion which outshine The School of Design at Carnegie Mellon’s website, the usage of some of principles were non-existent or inconsistent making TSOD CMU’s site the clear winner. For example, Panos K. Chrysanthis’s website shines in its use of proximity and its ease of orientation; however, its lack of breadcrumbs and organizational consistency prevent it from competing with TSOD CMU’s. Additionally, Realtor.com has an easier to understand implementation of breadcrumbs when looking at particular pages, such as a particular property listing, but it does not provide that set of bread crumbs on every page. Therefore, due to its good usage of proximity in regards to related content, such as headers and paragraphs, its decently navigable orientation due to its breadcrumbs, and its good usages of contrast and proximity, TSOD CMU’s website is the overall best of the five websites provided for critique.

                        <p>The Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County has a poorly designed website. Violating Krug’s first law of usability, the website makes me think. Firstly, the website is overcomplicated and has a high cognitive load. At first glance, I was paralyzed—before the jumbotron animated, I could not figure out where to look. Secondly, I should be able to automatically find the sites navigation options to accomplish a given task. However, due to the lack of white space, lack of simplicity, and lack of contrast, the content is hard to find. Finally, the website overuses animation thus overriding any potential hierarchical structures which could allow users to easily find the elements necessary to complete a given task. For example, while attempting to find the navigation bar, my eye was drawn to the animated jumbotron after being initially overwhelmed by the colors, then to the red emergency button before being drawn away by animated stream of articles. Overall, the websites visible language is jumbled and hard to decipher.

                    <h3> A Positive Perspective on New Streaming Services</h3> 
                    
                        
                       
<p>You can watch your favorite shows today, but will you be able tomorrow? In a world where cable television is slowly dying and streaming services have come to the forefront, power moves are being made by big players, such as Disney, to establish their own territory in the streaming industry (Cruz). These power moves will likely disrupt the delicate balance which keeps us in streaming stasis; however, I believe the results of the disruption could ultimately be beneficial.</p>
<p>In the short term, users will likely get the short end of the stick. Following Disney’s lead, many companies will try their hand at independence, remove their content from current services, and launch their own streaming services; however, their content will likely remain relatively similar to their current offerings resulting in only additional costs for consumers (Cruz). Yet, as long as consumers refuse to buy into their cash grabs, we will likely see a scramble amongst an array of new and old streaming services toward innovation through the production of original media, and this is a win for consumers.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if the companies succeed in creating new original content and drawing in customers, the content would have to be that of quality. In which case, the average consumer would be happy to enjoy their new favorites in exchange for a bunch of content they generally did not watch anyway.
On the other hand, if the majority of companies fail at innovation (which is most apt to happen) and become requisitioned, their reabsorption will create an oligopoly. That word is scary, but as it is now we are more or less in an oligopoly with Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon ruling the steaming scene. This newly refined oligopoly; however, will likely be more established and competitive. In time, I believe the oligopoly would adopt a model similar to that of the big three fast food chains--Wendy’s, Burger King, and McDonalds. They would each offer similar services, at similar prices, but with different brands and identities (Lufkin). To compete they would likely result to a similar model of aiming to acquire large user bases with low prices and maintaining them by utilizing periodic content creation to create brand loyalty.</p>
<p>In either scenario, customers have to be gained through unique and original content which is often hard to come by. Therefore, by breaking the current stasis, we will inevitably round around to at worst, services akin to what we already have or at best one that is cheaper, more content rich, and more competitive. According to Snider, “Netflix has already signed several creative deals”, and Amazon likewise has ”landed The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman and Skybound Entertainment...to develop exclusive TV series”, so despite my generally pessimistic views, I’ve decided to stay positive and anticipate the plethora of new quality entertainment which will be created in the upcoming steam wars.</p>

                      <h3>Writing Assignment 1</h3>
                       
                        <p>Unfortunately, in the world of business, it is very easy to allow oneself to be taken advantage of by clients. An excuse here, a dodged call there, and, before you know it, clients are months overdue on payments for your completed work. This is a reality for many startups, small business owners, and freelancers who often struggle to keep their lives and/or businesses afloat due to delinquency. Bianca Board and her business Web123 were one such a business as this until Bianca introduced a patient yet strict payment system. Board’s patient yet strict payment system is a very good model for any aspiring business.</p>
                        <p>Board’s system is centered around the establishment of clear boundaries and confidence. Clear boundaries, which include lengths of leniency, defined penalties, and methods of payment, help both parties by clearing any ambiguity of expectation. With clear boundaries, empathetic hearts can prevent their propensity toward over-leniency, and clients can more easily fulfill their end of the bargain due to the penalties of procrastination. When paired with a firm demeanor, patience, and confidence, Board’s model is not only effective and professional but admirable and endearing. It can enable businesses to say no, make more efficient deals, and get that which they are due.</p>
